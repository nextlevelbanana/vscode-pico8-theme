# vscode-pico8-theme
A PICO-8-inspired color theme for Visual Studio Code.

To use:
Open VSCode, hit control-P and type settings.json to open, well, settings.json. Delete any existing blocks of `workbench.colorCustomizations` or `editor.tokenColorCustomizations`. Paste the contents of my file into yours. Enjoy!

I know (or, I learned after I made this) that PICO-8 white is actually an off-white, I'll fix that soon.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please tell me! I feel like it's mostly done but could still use some tweaking.
